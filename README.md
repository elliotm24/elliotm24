Second year at the University of Oregon studying physics and mathematics. I am interested in research and pursuing a Ph.D in these fields. I am experienced with Python, JavaScript, and C. Currently, I am pursuing projects in chaotical dynamical systems through the math DRP program at the University of Oregon.

I am an avid soccer fan who enjoys watching La Liga and Serie A.
Â¡Hala Madrid!
